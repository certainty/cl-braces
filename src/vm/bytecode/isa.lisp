;;; The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a description of the instructions that are available in the virtual machine.
;;; It is used to construct instructions and to print the instructions in a human readable format.
;;; It also serves as the basis for the disassembler and the code generator so we have a single source of truth for the instructions.
;;;
;;; The ISA is defined using the define-isa macro, which is used to describe and define a new instruction set.
;;;
;;; Use the `print-isa' function to get information about the instructions that are available in the virtual machine.
;;; The default is will be bound to `*current-isa*' so you can use `(print-isa *current-isa*)' to get information about the current instruction set.
