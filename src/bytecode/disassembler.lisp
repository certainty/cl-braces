;;;; The disassembler gives insights into the encoded instructions.
;;;; This is useful for debugging purposes but also during development of the compiler and the VM itself.
;;;;
;;;; The main entry point is the `disass' function which takes a chunk of bytecode and prints it to the provided stream.
;;;; Example:
;;;;
;;;; ```common-lisp
;;;; (bytecode:disass (compiler:compile-string "3 + 4"))
;;;; ```
