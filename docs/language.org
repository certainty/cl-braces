The language that we're compiling is a subset of golang.
It doesn't support all of go's features but it follows basic go syntax and semantic.
The go language has been chosen because it's relatively small, yet uses
syntax and semantics that match the needs of modern software engineers.

We'll refer to our language as tinygo, going forward.

The following is probably one of the simplest golang and therefor also tinygo program.
In fact it will be the first program we'll aim to compile.

#+begin_src go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Hello world")
}
#+end_src
